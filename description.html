    <p class="playfair-display">Rohit Gurunath Sharma (born 30 April 1987) is an Indian international cricketer who currently captains the India national cricket team across all formats.<br>
        He is a right-handed batsman. Considered one of the best batsmen of his generation and one of the greatest opening batters of all time,Sharma is known for his timing, elegance, six-hitting abilities and leadership skills.<br> 
        Sharma holds several batting records which famously include most sixes in international cricket,most double centuries in ODI cricket (3), most centuries at Cricket World Cups (7) and joint most hundreds in Twenty20 Internationals (5).<br> 
        Rohit Sharma is the first player to score 5 T20I centuries.[5] He plays for Mumbai Indians in IPL and for Mumbai in domestic cricket.<br><br>
        
        
        Sharma formerly captained Mumbai Indians and the team has won 5 titles in 2013, 2015, 2017, 2019 and 2020 under his leadership, making him the most successful captain in IPL history, sharing this record with MS Dhoni (5 title wins in IPL).<br>
        With India, Sharma was a member of the team that won the 2007 T20 World Cup, and the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy, where he played in the finals of both tournaments.<br>
        Rohit is one of four players to have played in every edition of the ICC T20 World Cup, from the inaugural edition in 2007 to the latest one in 2022.<br><br>
    
        Sharma currently holds the world record for the highest individual score (264) in a One Day International (ODI) match and is the only player to have scored three double-centuries in ODIs and also holds the record for scoring most hundreds (five) in a single Cricket World Cup, for which he won the ICC Men's ODI Cricketer of the Year award in 2019.
        Sharma has received two national honours, the Arjuna Award in 2015 and the prestigious Major Dhyan Chand Khel Ratna Award in 2020 by the Government of India.
        Under his captaincy, India won the 2018 Asia Cup and the 2023 Asia Cup, the seventh and eighth time the country won the title, both in ODI format as well as the 2018 Nidahas Trophy, their second overall and first in T20I format.
        Outside cricket, Sharma is an active supporter of animal welfare campaigns. He is the official Rhino Ambassador for WWF-India and is a member of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA).
        He has worked with PETA in its campaign to raise awareness of the plight of homeless cats and dogs in India.<br><br>
    
        Sharma married his longtime girlfriend, Ritika Sajdeh on 13 December 2015 whom he first met in 2008. They have one child, a girl born on 30 December 2018 named Samaira.
        Sharma is a practitioner of the meditation technique Sahaj Marg.<br><br>
    
        Sharma has been sponsored by several brands including CEAT and the Swiss watchmaker Hublot.In his career, Sharma has endorsed many other brands including Maggi, Fair and Lovely, Lay's, Nissan, energy drink Relentless, Nasivion nasal spray, Aristocrat by VIP Industries, Adidas and Oppo mobiles.
        Sharma is an aggressive batsman but plays with style and elegance. He is usually an opening batsman in limited overs cricket, but has played most of his Test cricket as a middle-order batsman.In limited overs cricket, Sharma is widely recognised as one of the format's most outstanding batsmen.
        And for his attacking batting and six hitting abilities he often referred as Hitman.
        Sunil Gavaskar considers Sharma to have a batting style similar to those of Virender Sehwag and Viv Richards.
        In his column for The Times of India in November 2018, Gavaskar said:
        The standout performer in both the limited overs series and the T20 series has been Rohit Sharma.
        Like Virender Sehwag before him, he is unstoppable once he gets going and like Viru he has an appetite for big hundreds.
        When Viru used to get out looking to hit another delivery out of the park, there used to be consternation around the ground, just like it is when Rohit gets out to a seemingly casual shot. 
        If Rohit can turn his white ball exploits into red ball cricket, he will be the most destructive batsman in the world after Viv Richards and Virender Sehwag.
        While Sharma is not a regular bowler, he can bowl right-arm off spin.He usually fields in the slips and has said this is a part of his game which he works very hard on for improvement.<br><br>
